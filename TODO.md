    [ ] New Task Button
    [ ] Up/Down Buttons on hover next to svg task card?


* **I suppose that the option of  adding a new task, changing their order and saving tasklists** is not that much more. We already have the new task creation screen. But where to place the new task button? I suppose after the tasklist we could have the silhouette of a task, indented, that has a [+] button in there.

[ ] TODO Gesture recognition
